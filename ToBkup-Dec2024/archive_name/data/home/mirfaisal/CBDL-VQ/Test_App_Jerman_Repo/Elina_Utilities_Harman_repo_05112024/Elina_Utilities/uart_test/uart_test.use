Options:
  -n <name>      UART device name (default: /dev/ser2)
  -s <speed>     Set UART speed/baud rate in bps (default: 1000000)\n"
  -m <mode>      Set mode:  0: read-only; read inputted number of packets
                            1: write-only; write inputted number of packets
                            2: write-read; continuously write-read; should be used for loopback test

  -l <length>    Length of a packet in bytes (default: 256 bytes)
  -d <delay>     Delay in usec after which a packet will be transmitted; applicable for write operations only (default: 20000 usec)
  -v             Increase the verbosity of logs; accepted multiple times to increase verbosity further (min: 1, max: 8, default: 6)
  -h             Print this help message
