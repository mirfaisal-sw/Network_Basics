Default gateway
=================
The default gateway is the path used to pass information when the device doesn’t know where
the destination is. More directly, a default gateway is a router that connects our host to 
remote network segments. It’s the exit point for all the packets in your network that have
destinations outside our network.

route command: -
===============
route - show / manipulate the IP routing table.

When the add or del options are used, route modifies the routing tables. Without these options,
route displays the current contents of the routing tables.

1. Display your current routing table
--------------------------------------
	# route

	or

	# route -n

2. Add route rule command
-----------------------------
Syntax: -
	# route add -net <ip_address> netmask <netmask_address_here> gw <gw_address_here>

Ex.: Route all traffic via 192.168.1.254 gateway connected via eth0 network interface:

	# route add default gw 192.168.1.254 eth0

Do the same using "ip" command: -
	# ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0
	
=> Verify newly added route ip address in the Linux kernel routing table

	# route -n
	
	or
	
	# ip route list
	
3. Verify new routing is working or not
----------------------------------------
Use the ping command to verify connectivity to your router or external network:
	# ping your-router-ip-here
	# ping your-ISPs-Gateway-ip-here
	# ping 192.168.1.254
	# ping www.cyberciti.biz

We should able to ping public IP address too. For instance:
	# ping 1.1.1.1
	# ping 8.8.8.8

4. Deleting route rule command
--------------------------------
Sometimes we need to delete route. The syntax is:
	# route del -net <ip_address_here> netmask <netmask_address_here> dev <gw_interface_here>

To delete the default route, labeled “default” or 0.0.0.0, from the current routing table, type:
	# route del default
