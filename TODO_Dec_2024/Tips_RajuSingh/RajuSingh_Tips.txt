You also need to understand config files, Kconfig, makefile in application and in linux kernel.

For Debugging: JTAG, tracing in linux kernel, gdb, kgdb, trace32.

Also understand various peripherals protocols like SPI, UART and I2C.

You can start from the memory char device driver using the above videos and books.

Also go through ramp up docs including quilt, git , gerrit,  ath10k/ath11k.

You can let me know back if you are still facing the issue.

Happy Learning :) 

Thanks,
Nishant
