netlink: - communication between kernel and user space (AF_NETLINK)

Netlink is used to transfer information between the kernel and user-space processes. It consists of a standard sockets-based
interface for user space processes and an internal kernel API for kernel modules.

User space API: -
  #include <asm/types.h>
  #include <sys/socket.h>
  #include <linux/netlink.h>
  
  netlink_socket = socket(AF_NETLINK, socket_type, netlink_family);

Netlink is a datagram-oriented service.  Both SOCK_RAW and SOCK_DGRAM are valid values for socket_type.  However, the
netlink protocol does not distinguish between datagram and raw sockets.

netlink_family selects the kernel module or netlink group to communicate with.  The currently assigned netlink families are:

NETLINK_ROUTE
      Receives routing and link updates and may be used to modify the routing tables (both IPv4 and IPv6), IP
      addresses, link parameters, neighbor setups, queueing disciplines, traffic classes, and packet classifiers (see
      rtnetlink(7)).

NETLINK_W1 (Linux 2.6.13 to Linux 2.16.17)
      Messages from 1-wire subsystem.

NETLINK_USERSOCK
      Reserved for user-mode socket protocols.

NETLINK_FIREWALL (up to and including Linux 3.4)
      Transport IPv4 packets from netfilter to user space. Used by ip_queue kernel module. After a long period of being
      declared obsolete (in favor of the more advanced nfnetlink_queue feature), NETLINK_FIREWALL was removed in
      Linux 3.5.

NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG (since Linux 3.3)
      Query information about sockets of various protocol families from the kernel (see sock_diag(7)).

NETLINK_INET_DIAG (since Linux 2.6.14)
      An obsolete synonym for NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG.

NETLINK_NFLOG (up to and including Linux 3.16)
      Netfilter/iptables ULOG.

NETLINK_XFRM
      IPsec.

NETLINK_SELINUX (since Linux 2.6.4)
      SELinux event notifications.

NETLINK_ISCSI (since Linux 2.6.15)
      Open-iSCSI.

NETLINK_AUDIT (since Linux 2.6.6)
      Auditing.

NETLINK_FIB_LOOKUP (since Linux 2.6.13)
      Access to FIB lookup from user space.

NETLINK_CONNECTOR (since Linux 2.6.14)
      Kernel connector.  See
      Documentation/driver-api/connector.rst (or /Documentation/connector/connector.*  in Linux 5.2 and
      earlier) in the Linux kernel source tree for further information.

NETLINK_NETFILTER (since Linux 2.6.14)
      Netfilter subsystem.

NETLINK_SCSITRANSPORT (since Linux 2.6.19)
      SCSI Transports.

NETLINK_RDMA (since Linux 3.0)
      Infiniband RDMA.

NETLINK_IP6_FW (up to and including Linux 3.4)
      Transport IPv6 packets from netfilter to user space.  Used by ip6_queue kernel module.

NETLINK_DNRTMSG
      DECnet routing messages.

NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT (since Linux 2.6.10)
      Kernel messages to user space.

NETLINK_GENERIC (since Linux 2.6.15)
      Generic netlink family for simplified netlink usage.

NETLINK_CRYPTO (since Linux 3.2)
      Netlink interface to request information about ciphers registered with the kernel crypto API as well as allow
      configuration of the kernel crypto API.

Netlink messages consist of a byte stream with one or multiple nlmsghdr headers and associated payload.  The byte stream should
be accessed only with the standard NLMSG_* macros.
